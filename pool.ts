/**
 * Connection pools are a powerful resource to execute parallel queries and
 * save up time in connection initialization. It is highly recommended that all
 * applications that require concurrent access use a pool to communicate
 * with their PostgreSQL database
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Pool } from "./pool.ts";
 *
 * const pool = new Pool({
 *   database: "database",
 *   hostname: "hostname",
 *   password: "password",
 *   port: 5432,
 *   user: "user",
 * }, 10); // Creates a pool with 10 available connections
 *
 * const client = await pool.connect();
 * await client.queryArray`SELECT 1`;
 * client.release();
 * ```
 *
 * You can also opt to not initialize all your connections at once by passing the `lazy`
 * option when instantiating your pool, this is useful to reduce startup time. In
 * addition to this, the pool won't start the connection unless there isn't any already
 * available connections in the pool
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Pool } from "./pool.ts";
 *
 * // Creates a pool with 10 max available connections
 * // Connection with the database won't be established until the user requires it
 * const pool = new Pool({}, 10, true);
 *
 * // Connection is created here, will be available from now on
 * const client_1 = await pool.connect();
 * await client_1.queryArray`SELECT 1`;
 * await client_1.release();
 *
 * // Same connection as before, will be reused instead of starting a new one
 * const client_2 = await pool.connect();
 * await client_2.queryArray`SELECT 1`;
 *
 * // New connection, since previous one is still in use
 * // There will be two open connections available from now on
 * const client_3 = await pool.connect();
 * await client_2.release();
 * await client_3.release();
 * ```
