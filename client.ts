  /**
   * Transactions are a powerful feature that guarantees safe operations by allowing you to control
   * the outcome of a series of statements and undo, reset, and step back said operations to
   * your liking
   *
   * In order to create a transaction, use the `createTransaction` method in your client as follows:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   * const client = new Client();
   * const transaction = client.createTransaction("my_transaction_name");
   *
   * await transaction.begin();
   * // All statements between begin and commit will happen inside the transaction
   * await transaction.commit(); // All changes are saved
   * ```
   *
   * All statements that fail in query execution will cause the current transaction to abort and release
   * the client without applying any of the changes that took place inside it
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   * const client = new Client();
   * const transaction = client.createTransaction("transaction");
   *
   * await transaction.begin();
   * await transaction.queryArray`INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (X) VALUES ${"some_value"}`;
   * try {
   *   await transaction.queryArray`SELECT []`; // Invalid syntax, transaction aborted, changes won't be applied
   * }catch(e){
   *   await transaction.commit(); // Will throw, current transaction has already finished
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This however, only happens if the error is of execution in nature, validation errors won't abort
   * the transaction
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   * const client = new Client();
   * const transaction = client.createTransaction("transaction");
   *
   * await transaction.begin();
   * await transaction.queryArray`INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (X) VALUES ${"some_value"}`;
   * try {
   *   await transaction.rollback("unexistent_savepoint"); // Validation error
   * } catch(e) {
   *   await transaction.commit(); // Transaction will end, changes will be saved
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * A transaction has many options to ensure modifications made to the database are safe and
   * have the expected outcome, which is a hard thing to accomplish in a database with many concurrent users,
   * and it does so by allowing you to set local levels of isolation to the transaction you are about to begin
   *
   * Each transaction can execute with the following levels of isolation:
   *
   * - Read committed: This is the normal behavior of a transaction. External changes to the database
   *   will be visible inside the transaction once they are committed.
   *
   * - Repeatable read: This isolates the transaction in a way that any external changes to the data we are reading
   *   won't be visible inside the transaction until it has finished
   *   ```ts
   *   import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   *   const client = new Client();
   *   const transaction = await client.createTransaction("my_transaction", { isolation_level: "repeatable_read" });
   *   ```
   *
   * - Serializable: This isolation level prevents the current transaction from making persistent changes
   *   if the data they were reading at the beginning of the transaction has been modified (recommended)
   *   ```ts
   *   import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   *   const client = new Client();
   *   const transaction = await client.createTransaction("my_transaction", { isolation_level: "serializable" });
   *   ```
   *
   * Additionally, each transaction allows you to set two levels of access to the data:
   *
   * - Read write: This is the default mode, it allows you to execute all commands you have access to normally
   *
   * - Read only: Disables all commands that can make changes to the database. Main use for the read only mode
   *   is to in conjuction with the repeatable read isolation, ensuring the data you are reading does not change
   *   during the transaction, specially useful for data extraction
   *   ```ts
   *   import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   *   const client = new Client();
   *   const transaction = await client.createTransaction("my_transaction", { read_only: true });
   *   ```
   *
   * Last but not least, transactions allow you to share starting point snapshots between them.
   * For example, if you initialized a repeatable read transaction before a particularly sensible change
   * in the database, and you would like to start several transactions with that same before the change state
   * you can do the following:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { Client } from "./client.ts";
   *
   * const client_1 = new Client();
   * const client_2 = new Client();
   * const transaction_1 = client_1.createTransaction("transaction_1");
   *
   * const snapshot = await transaction_1.getSnapshot();
   * const transaction_2 = client_2.createTransaction("new_transaction", { isolation_level: "repeatable_read", snapshot });
   * // transaction_2 now shares the same starting state that transaction_1 had
   * ```
